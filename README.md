# kata-trader

Trading algorithmic repo using changepoint analysis and regression modelling to make optimal 
trading decisions. 

## Requirements. 

Ensure you are using python3.11+. A docker file has not been created yet but in the future 
will be used for development. 

Preferred operating system is Ubuntu Jammy 22.04 LTS. 

## Installation 

I use homebrew on both linux and mac because it makes it more standardized. 

```bash
# install homebrew 
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# install python3.11
sudo brew install python3.11
```

note by installing this formula with homebrew you also install pip. 

Install docker from the following link:
